# Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra - Vectors, Matrices, and Least Squares

## Chapter 1: Vectors

### Exercise solutions:

#### Exercise 1:

a. True and valid notation\
b. Not a valid notation\
c. Valid notation and true (stacked vector)

#### Exercise 2:

a. correct notation - same size vectors of addition/subtraction\
b. correct notation - stacked vectors\
c. incorrect notation - different sized vectors (10 vs 20)\
d. correct notation\
e. correct notation\
f. incorect notation\
g. correct notation\

#### Exercise 3:

a. correct notation and unambigous\
b. correct notation but invalid (different size)
c. correct but ambigous\
d. valid notation but incorrect


#### Exercise 4: Periodic energy usage.

a. w = (d,d,d,d,d,d,d)\
b. d = w<sub>1:24</sub>



#### Exercise 5: Interpreting sparsity\

(a) x represents the daily cash flow of some business over n days: 
 ***Zero cashflow on most days of the business***  
(b) x represents the annual dollar value purchases by a customer of n products or services: ***Customer did not spend on most products or services in that year.***  
(c) x represents a portfolio, say, the dollar value holdings of n stocks: ***portfolio contains only a few of n stocks***  
(d) x represents a bill of materials for a project, i.e., the amounts of n materials needed: *** project requires only few of the n materials***.  
(e) x represents a monochrome image, i.e., the brightness values of n pixels: ***the image is mostly dark e.g. imaging a dark sky with few distant stars/galaxies***  
(f) x is the daily rainfall in a location over one year. ***how it feels like living in death valley***
